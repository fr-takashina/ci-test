Design
============================================

Here is a sample for a basic design document.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   usecase
   business_process
   data_flow_diagram
   class_diagram

.. note:: You need VSCode + draw.io plugin to edit `.drawio.svg` files.

.. warning:: Keep it small and simple. Too large and/or too detailed design documents are hard to maintain. Such documents would be abandoned.
